    <div class="content-container" id="contentContainer">
        Forget you're alive and that any of this shit actually matters. Nothing is real, and everything 
        is an illusion. Play the game, but realize it's just a game. It's just a ride. Everything is facade 
        created by your perception systems. Your ego and identities are all but illusions. Your grave will 
        eventually be forgotten, and your bones will return to the earth. Nothing of you will exist 
        expect within the memories of other people. At the end of the day, nobody really gets 
        what they want in life and that is a beautiful thing. You know what the number one regret people 
        have on their deathbed is? It's not "I wish people liked me more" - it's more like
        "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
